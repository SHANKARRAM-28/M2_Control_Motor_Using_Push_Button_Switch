OBJECTIVE
	The objective of the project is to control the motor.
	The purpose of the project is to minimize the electrical loss by avoiding the unwanted using of power.
EXISTING SYSTEM
	In this system the motor has been controlled using the push button.
	This helps in controlling the power loss.
	The push button used here is operates the motor.
PROPOSED SYSTEM
	The proposed system consists of the microcontroller as Atmega 328p.
	Microcontroller is connected with the push button.
	That helps in operating the motor.
